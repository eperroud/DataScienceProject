## Description

[Detailed description of your machine learning project, its goals, and main functionalities.]

## Installation

[Step-by-step instructions on how to install and set up your project, including any dependencies or requirements.]

## Usage
In order to run the code properly you have two options : 
  1. Run the DataTransformation.ipynb first which will provide two new datasets with all necessary modifications :       'final_test.csv' and 'final_training.csv'

  2. Directly import the existing 'final_test.csv' and 'final_training.csv' available from the data folder in the repository.

Once this is done, you can select which of the model you would like to use to make predictions in the folder Predictions. 

## Data
